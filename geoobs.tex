\section{Introduction}
\pagenumbering{arabic}

An obstacle representation of an (undirected simple) graph $G$ is
pair $(\varphi, S)$ where $\varphi:V(G)\to\R^2$ maps vertices of $G$
to distinct points in $\R^2$ and $S$ is a set of connected subsets of
$\R^2$ with the property that, for every $u,w\in V(G)$, $uw\in E(G)$
if and only if the line segment $\varphi(u)\varphi(w)$ is disjoint from
$\cup S$.  The elements of $S$ are called \emph{obstacles}.

It is easy to see that every graph $G$ has an obstacle representation:
Take any $\varphi$ that does not map three vertices of $G$ onto a single
line. This gives a straight-line drawing of $G$ whose edges form an
arrangement of line segments.  Now take $S$ to consist of the open faces
in this arrangement.  Since every graph has an obstacle representation,
this defines a natural graph parameter called the \emph{obstacle number}:
\[
     \ob(G) = \min\{|S| :\text{$(\varphi, S)$ is an obstacle representation of $G$}\} \enspace .
\]
Since their introduction by So and So, obstacle numbers have been studied
extensively, with the main goal of bounding the obstacle numbers of
various classes of graphs.  It is known that every $n$-vertex graph has
obstacle number $O(n\log n)$ \cite{X} and some $n$-vertex graphs have
obstacle number $\Omega(n/(\log\log n)^2)$ \cite{Y}.  For planar graphs,
our understanding is muddier: There exists planar graphs with obstacle
number 2 \emph{X} (the icosahedron is an example), but the best upper
bound on the obstacle number of an $n$-vertex planar graph is $O(n)$.

For planar graphs there is also a natural notion of a \emph{plane obstacle
representation} $(\varphi, S)$ which is an obstacle representation
in which $\varphi$ defines a plane straight-line embedding of $G$.
This leads to a \emph{plane obstacle number}
\[
    \planeobs(G) = \min\{|S| :\text{$(\varphi, S)$ is a plane obstacle representation of $G$}\} \enspace .
\]
Using Euler's Formula, it is not hard to see that the plane obstacle
number of any $n$-vertex planar graph is $O(n)$: Let $\varphi$ define
any plane drawing of $G$ with no three vertices collinear and take $S$
to be the set of open faces in this drawing.  Since an $n$-vertex planar
graph has at most $2n-4$ faces, this implies $\planeobs(G)\le 2n-4$.
A lower bound of $\Omega(n)$ is also not difficult:  Any plane drawing
of the $\sqrt{n}\times\sqrt{n}$ grid $G_{\sqrt{n}\times\sqrt{n}}$
has at least $n-2\sqrt{n}$ bounded faces. Each of these faces has
at least four vertices and therefore requires at least one obstacle,
so $\planeobs(G_{\sqrt{n}\times\sqrt{n}})\ge n-2\sqrt{n}$.  So and so
\cite{X} have nailed the leading constant by showing that every planar
graph has obstacle number at most $n-x$ and some planar graphs have
obstacle number $n-x$.

\subsection{A Generalization}

We would like to generalize the notion of obstacle numbers to metric
spaces other than $\R^2$ with the Euclidean distance metric.  Before we
can do this, though, we need a notion of a metric space that is also
equipped with some topology.

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space.  A \emph{curve} over $X$ is a function
$f:[0,1]\to X$.  We call $f(0)$ and $f(1)$ the \emph{endpoints} of the
curve $f$ and define the \emph{image} of $f$ as $I(f)=\{f(t):0\le t\le
1\}$.  A curve $f$ is a \emph{geodesic} if, for every $0\le t\le 1$,
$d(f(0),f(t)) + d(f(t),f(1)) = d(f(0),f(1))$.

A \emph{path space} is a triple $(X,d,C)$, where $(X,d)$ is a metric
space and $C$ is a set of curves over $X$ that has the following closure
property:  If the curve $f$ is in $C$ then, for every $0\le t\le 1$,
$C$ also contains the curves $g(x)=f(x/t)$ and $h(x)=f(t+x/(1-t)$.
A path space $(X,d,C)$ is \emph{connected} if, for every distinct pair
$u,w\in X$, there is some path in $C$ with endpoints $u$ and $w$.

For a path space $P=(X,d,C)$ and a subset $S\subset X$, we denote the
subspace induced by $S$ as $P[S]=(S,d,\{f\in C:I(f)\subseteq S\})$.  The
subspace that avoids $S$ is defined ias $P\setminus S = P[X\setminus S]$.

As examples, we can $X=\R^2$ and $C$ to be the set of all closed
continuous curves over $\R^2$.  Now, if we take $d$ to be the Euclidean
metric, then the geodesics in $C$ are straight line segments.  A more
interesting example (and one we will study) is when we take $d$ to be
the $L_1$ (Manhattan) distance, in which case the geodesics in $C$ are
x-y-monotone paths.  As a discrete example, we could take $X$ to be the
vertex set of some graph $G$, $d(p,q)$ to be distance in $G$ from $p$
to $q$, and $C$ to be the set of all paths in $G$. In this case the
geodesics in $C$ are the shortest paths in $G$.

With these definitions in hand, we are ready to define a generalization of
obstacle representations.  

\begin{defn}
An \emph{$(X,d,C)$ obstacle representation} of a graph $G$ is a pair
$(\varphi, S)$ where $\varphi:V(G)\to X$ is a one-to-one mapping and
$S$ is a set of connected subsets of $X$ with the property that, for
every $u,w\in V(G)$, $uw\in E(G)$ if and only if $C$ contains a $\cup
S$-avoiding geodesic with endpoints $\varphi(u)$ and $\varphi(w)$.
\end{defn}

Note that, for a given $(X,d,C)$ it is not at all obvious whether every
graph $G$ has an \emph{$(X,d,C)$ obstacle representation}.  Indeed,
the focus of this paper is to determine, for a class $\mathcal{G}$ of
graphs and a particular path space $(X,d,C)$, whether or not every
member of $\mathcal{G}$ has an $(X,d,C)$ obstacle representation.
As it happens, this question is closely related to certain types of
embeddings of $G$ into $X$.

An \emph{embedding} $(\varphi,c)$ of a graph $G$ into $X$ consists
of a one-to-one map $\varphi:V(G)\to X$ and a function $c: E(G)\to
\mathcal{C}(X)$.  The embedding is \emph{geodesic} if, for every $uw\in
E(G)$, $c(uw)$ is a geodesic.  The embedding is \emph{non-crossing} if,
for every $uw,xz\in E(G)$ with $\{u,w\}\cap \{x,z\}=\emptyset$, $c(uw)$
is disjoint from $c(xz)$.  Note that this definition says nothing about
two edges that share a common vertex.

Given a $(X,d,C)$ obstacle representation $(\varphi,S)$ of $G$, we can
choose, for each $uw\in E(G)$, some $S$-avoiding geodesic $c(uw)\in C$
with endpoints $\varphi(u)$ and $\varphi(w)$.  The pair $(\varphi,c)$
then gives a geodesic embedding of $G$ into $X$.  If it is possible to
choose $c$ so that $(\varphi,c)$ is also non-crossing, then we say that
the representation $(\varphi,S)$ is non-crossing.

In this paper, we mostly focus on non-crossing $(X,d,C)$ obstacle
representations where $X=\R^2$, $d$ is some polygonal distance function,
and $C=\mathcal{C}_2$ is the set of closed continuous curves over $\R^2$.
Let $d_k$ denote the distance function over $\R^2$ where a ``circle''
is a regular $2k$-gon.  Formally,
\[  
   d_k(p,q)=\min\left\{\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}|a_i|: 
                        q-p=\sum_{i=0}^{k-i}a_iv_i\right\} \enspace ,
\]
where $v_i=(\cos(i\pi/k), \sin(i\pi/k))$. 

For the sake of compactness, we use \emph{$d_k$ obstacle representation}
as shorthand for $d_k$ obstacle representation.
We prove the following results:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item For any integer $k$, there is a graph that does not have a
     $d_k$ obstacle representation.
   \item Every planar graph of treewidth at most 2 (and hence every
     outerplanar graph) has a non-crossing $d_2$ obstacle
     representation.
   \item Not every planar 3-tree has a non-crossing $d_2$
     obstacle representation.
   \item Not every planar 4-connected triangulation has a 
     non-crossing $d_2$ obstacle representation.
   \item Every planar graph of treewidth at most 3 has a 
     non-crossing $d_3$ obstacle representation.
   \item Every planar graph has a non-crossing $d_5$
     obstacle representation.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Preliminaries}

Here we present some definitions and observations that are useful
throughout the rest of the paper.  

Path spaces are so general that there are unlikely to be very few
universal results about them.  However, the following is one such
useful result:

\begin{obs}\obslabel{induced}
   If a graph $G$ has a $(X,d,C)$ obstacle representation
   $(\varphi,S)$, then   $(\varphi, S)$ is also a $(X,d,C)$ obstacle
   representation for every induced subgraph of $G$.
\end{obs}

\obsref{induced} follows immediately from the fact that, for two vertices
$u$ and $w$ in the induced subgraph $G'$, $uw\in E[G']$ if and only if
$uw\in E[G]$.

Next, we justify a former of generic position assumption that
simplifies discussions later.  We say that a set of points in $\R^2$
is \emph{$d_k$-generic}, if it contains no pair of distinct $p$ and $q$
such that $p-q= t(\cos(i\pi/k),\sin(i\pi/k)$ for some integer $i$.

\begin{obs}\obslabel{generic}
  If $G$ has a $d_k$ obstacle representation, then it
  has an $d_k$ obstacle representation $(\varphi, S)$
  in which $\{\varphi(u):u\in V(G)\}$ is $d_k$-generic.
\end{obs}

\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch]
   Consider all the $2kn$ lines that determine $d_k$ genericness.
   For every point $p$ on one of these lines, $\ell$ that is not
   part of any obstacle, we remove an $\eps$-length line segment
   centered at $p$ and perpendicular to $\ell$. The result is still
   an $d_k$ obstacle representation of $G$.  Now we can
   perform a sufficiently small rotation of the entire representation
   so that it becomes $d_k$-generic.
\end{proof}

Justified by \obsref{generic} we will, from this point onwards
assume that any obstacle representation is $d_k$ generic (for the
appropriate value of $k$) and that the tangent vector to any point on
any geodesic does not form an angle of $i\pi/k$ with the x-axis, for
any $i\in\{0,\ldots,2k-1\}$.

\subsection{$k$-Monotone Curves}

For any $k\in\N$, $i\in\{0,\ldots,2k-1\}$, and $u\in\R^2$, define the
$i$th $k$-sector of $u$ as
\[
   Q^{k}_i(u) = 
     \{ u+r: r\in\R^2,\,\lfloor i\pi/k < \angle(u+(1,0),u,r) < (i+1)\pi/k \}
\]
Where $\angle (a,b,c)\in[0,2\pi)$ denotes the counterclockwise angle
between the segments $ab$ and $cb$.  A curve $f:[0,1]\to\R^2$ is
\emph{$k$-monotone in direction $i$} if $f(b)\in Q^k_i(f(a))$ for all
$0 \le a < b \le 1$.  We say that $f$ is \emph{$k$-monotone} if there
exists some $i\in\{0,\ldots,2k-1\}$ such that $f$ is $k$-monotone in
direction $i$.  

Observe that any $k$-monotone curve is a geodesic under the $d_k$
distance function and, by the assumption in the preceding section,
any geodesic we work with is a $k$-monotone curve.
We will now start naming curves using their two endpoints.  Thus,
if we say $uw$ is a curve, then we mean that $uw$ is a curve $f$ with
$f(0)=u$ and $f(1)=w$.  The following is an important observation about
$k$-monotone curves that cross.

\begin{obs}\obslabel{quadrilateral}
   If $uw$ and $xz$ are curves that are each $k$-monotone direction in $i$
   and $uw\cap xz$ contains at least one point $p$, then $d_k(u,z) =
   d_k(u,p)+d_k(p,z)$ and $d_k(x,w)=d_k(x,p)+d_k(p,w)$.
\end{obs}

\subsection{$k$-Monotone Embeddings}

An embedding $(\varphi,c)$ of a graph $G$ into $\R^2$
is \emph{plane} if, for every edge $uw\in E(G)$, $c(uw)$
is disjoint from $\{\varphi(x) : x\in V(G)\setminus\{u,w\}\}$
and, for each pair of distinct edges $uw,xz\in E(G)$, $c(uw)\cap
c(xz)\subseteq\{\varphi(u),\varphi(w),\varphi(x),\varphi(z)\}$. 
From this point onwards, when we are discussing a particular embedding
of $G$, we will identify each vertex $u$ of $G$ with $\varphi(u)$ and
each edge $uw$ of $G$ with the curve $c(uw)$.

\begin{defn}
An embedding of $G$ into $\R^2$ is a \emph{$d_k$-obstacle embedding}
if each edge $uw$ of $G$ is $k$-monotone and, for each $u,w\in V(G)$,
the embedding contains a $k$-monotone path from $u$ to $w$ if and only
if $uw\in E(G)$.
\end{defn}

Note that, from a $d_k$ obstacle representation $(\varphi, S)$ we
can obtain a $d_k$ obstacle embedding $(\varphi, c)$ by taking each
$c(uw)$ to be any $S$-avoiding geodesic with endpoints $u$ and $w$.
However, the converse is not necessarily true.  Given a $d_k$ obstacle
embedding of $G$, taking $S=\R^2\setminus (\bigcup_{uw\in E(G)}c(uw))\cup
(\bigcup_{u\in V(G)} \phi(u)$ does not necessarily yield a $d_k$ obstacle
representation $(\varphi,S)$ of $G$.  The problem occurs because of
\obsref{quadrilateral} when two edges $uw$ and $xz$ are both $k$ monotone in
direction $i$ and they cross. This leaves $S$-avoiding geodesics from $u$
to $z$ and $x$ to $w$ even though $uz$ and $xw$ may not be edges of $G$.



\section{General Representations}

Our first result is a negative one:

\begin{thm}\thmlabel{plane-lower-bound}
  There exists a constant $a>0$ such that, for every $k\in \N$, and every
  $n\ge ak^2$, there exist an $n$-vertex bipartite graph $G$ with maximum
  degree $O(k)$ that has no $d_k$ obstacle representation.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
   Erd\H{o}s, R\'enyi, and S\'os \cite{erdos.renyi.ea:1966} showed that,
   for some $c>0$, for every $n\ge 2$, there exists a bipartite graph
   $G$ with $n$ vertices $cn^{3/2}$ edges, maximum degree $cn^{1/2}$
   and that contains no $K_{2,2}$ subgraph.  Let $(\varphi,S)$ be a
   $d_k$ obstacle representation and let $(\varphi,c)$
   be an embedding of $G$ obtained by taking $c(uw)$ to be some shortest
   $S$-avoiding path from $\varphi(u)$ to $\varphi(w)$.

   Each edge $uw\in E(G)$ is $k$-monotone in direction $i$ for some
   $i\in\{0,\ldots,k-1\}$.  By the pigeonhole principle, there is
   some direction $i$ for which at least $cn^{3/2}/k\ge acn$ edges
   are monotone in direction $i$.  By Euler's formula, if $ac\ge 3$,
   the graph consisting only of these edges is not planar, therefore
   there is some pair of edges $uw$ and $xz$ that are both monotone in
   direction $i$ and that have some point $p$ in common.

   But now we have $d(u,z)=d(u,p)+d(p,z)$.  Therefore, there is a shortest
   $S$-avoiding path from $u$ to $z$, so $uz\in E(G)$.  Similarly, there
   is a shortest $S$-avoiding path from $x$ to $w$, so $xw\in E(G)$.
   But this is a contradiction since it implies that $u$, $w$, $x$,
   and $z$ form a $K_{2,2}$.
\end{proof}

As $k\to\infty$, $d_k$ becomes the usual Euclidean distance function
and $d_k$-obstacle representations are just the usual obstacle
representations, which we know every graph has.  Thus, for every $n\in
N$, there is a threshold value $k(n)$ such that every $n$-vertex graph
has a $d_{k(n)}$ obstacle representation.  \thmref{plane-lower-bound}
shows that $k(n)\in \Omega(\sqrt{n})$, and the following theorem shows
$k(n)\in O(n)$.

\begin{thm}
   Every $n$-vertex graph $G$ has a $d_k$ obstacle representation for $k=\lceil n/2\rceil$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
   Consider the regular $2k$-gon with vertices at $(\cos((i+1/2)\pi/k),
   \sin((i+1/2)\pi/k))$, for $i\in\{0,\ldots,2k-1\}$.  It is well known
   that the pairs of vertices of this $2k$-gon determine only $k$
   distinct directions and that these directions are $(i+1/2)\pi/k$
   for $i=\{0,\ldots,k-1\}$.

   Therefore, to take obtain an obstacle representation of $G$, place
   its vertices on this regular 2k-gon, join its vertices with straight
   line segments and take the obstacles to be the faces of the resulting
   arrangement of line segments.  That this is an obstacle representation
   follows from the fact that no $k$-monotone path uses two different
   directions determined pairs of vertices and no two edges in the same
   direction cross each other.
\end{proof}

\question{Determine the growth of $k(n)$.}

The graphs in the proof of \thmref{plane-lower-bound} have $\Omega(kn)$
edges and therefore have vertices of degree $\Omega(k)$.  

\question{Is it true that, for every $\Delta$, there exists a $k(\Delta)$ such that every graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ has a $d_{k(\Delta)}$ obstacle representation?}

The proof of \thmref{plane-lower-bound} makes critical use of the fact
that $d_k$ obstacle representations live in the plane to ensure that
a sufficiently dense graph has a pair of edges that cross. An obvious
question then is whether every graph has $(\R^3,d_{\hexagon},C_3)$
obstacle representation where $d_{\hexagon}$ is some polyhedral distance
function and $C_3$ is the set of closed connected curves in $\R^3$.
The answer is no.


\begin{thm}
  For every $p\in\N$, and every polyhedral distance function $d_{\hexagon}$ over $\R^d$, there exists a graph $G$ that has no $(\R^p, d_{\hexagon}, C_p)$ obstacle representation.
\end{thm}


\begin{proof}
  Let $G$ be an $n$-vertex graph with no clique and no independent set of
  size larger than $2\log n$. The existence of such graphs was shown by
  Erd\H{o}s and Renyi \cite{X}. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction,
  that $G$ has some $(\R^p, d_{\hexagon}, C_p)$ obstacle representation
  $(\varphi,S)$. Let $\prec$ denote lexicographic order over points
  in $\R^{p}$.

  Now, the polyhedral distance function $d_{\hexagon}$ defines some
  centrally symmetric polyhedron $P$ such that, for any $u,w\in
  \R^p$ with $u\prec w$, the scaled and translated polyhedron
  $P_{uw}=u+d_{\hexagon}(u,w)\cdot P$ contains the point $w$ on its
  boundary.  If $P$ has $k$ facets, this defines a $k$-colouring of
  the ordered pairs of vertices of $G$, where $uw$, with $u\prec w$,
  is colored by the facet of $P_{uw}$ that contains $w$.  (If $w$
  is incident to more than one facet of $P_{uw}$, then choose one arbitrarily to
  determine the colour of $uw$.)

  For each $i\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$, let $\prec_i$ denote the partial
  order obtained by restricting the total order $\prec$ to the pairs of
  vertices in $G$ with colour $i$.  We claim that for at least one $i$,
  $\prec_i$ contains a chain $v_1\prec_i\cdots\prec_i v_r$ of length
  $r\ge n^{1/k}$.  To see why this is so, observe that, by Dilwerth's
  Theorem, if $\prec_k$ does not contain a chain of length $n^{1/k}$,
  then it contains an antichain $A_k$ of size $n^{1-1/k}$.  Now proceed
  inductively on $\prec_1,\ldots,\prec_{k-1}$ and $A_k$, observing that
  every pair in $A_k$ is coloured with $\{1,\ldots,k-1\}$.

  Back to our embedding, the sequence $v_1,\ldots,v_r$ is such that for
  any $i<j<k$, the union of a geodesic $f_{ij}$ with endpoints $v_i$
  and $v_j$ and a geodesic $f_{jk}$ with endpoints $v_j$ and $v_k$
  is a geodesic with endpoints $v_i$ and $v_k$.
  
  So now, consider the subgraph $G'$ of $G$ induced by
  $v_1,\ldots,v_r$. From the preceding discussion, it follows that $G$
  is a collection of vertex-disjoint cliques.  But this means that
  $G'$ (and hence $G$) must contains a clique of size $\sqrt{r}$ or
  an independent set of size $\sqrt{r}$.  Recall that $r\ge
  n^{1/k}$, so this contradicts our choice of $G$, if $n^{1/2k} \ge
  2\log n$, which is true for all sufficiently large $n$.
\end{proof}





\section{Non-Crossing Representations}

In this section, we consider non-crossing $d_k$ obstacle
representations. The following lemma shows that these representations
are equivalent to plane $d_k$ obstacle embeddings.

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{monotone}
   A graph $G$ has a non-crossing $d_k$ obstacle representation if and
   only $G$ has a plane $d_k$ obstacle embedding.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
   First, suppose $G$ has a plane $d_k$-obstacle embedding $(\varphi,c)$.
   Then we claim that by taking $S= \R^2\setminus \bigcup_{uw\in E(G)}
   c(uw)\cup \bigcup_{u\in V(G)}\varphi(u)$, we obtain an obstacle
   representation $(\varphi,S)$ .

   If $uw\in E(G)$ then $uw$ is an $S$-avoiding $k$-monotone curve.
   On the other hand if $uw\not\in E(G)$ then, since $(\varphi,c)$
   is plane, any $S$-avoiding $k$-monotone curve with endpoints $u$
   and $w$ would determine a $k$-monotone path from $u$ to $w$ in $G$.
   The definition of $d_k$ obstacle embedding does not allow this.

   Next we argue that a $d_k$ non-crossing obstacle representation
   $(\varphi, S)$ impmlies the existence of a plane $d_k$-obstacle
   embedding $(\varphi, c')$ of $G$.  of $G$.  By the
   definition of non-crossing, we immediately obtain a function
   $c:E(G)\to\mathcal{C}(\R^2)$ that maps edges of $G$ onto geodesic
   curves joining their endpoints, and any two of these curves are
   disjoint unless they share a common endpoint.

   The resulting embedding $(\varphi,c)$ is almost a plane $d_k$-obstacle
   embedding except that it may contains pairs of edges $ux$ and $uz$
   such that $c(ux)$ and $c(uz)$ cross each other.  In this case,
   we observe that both $ux$ and $uz$ are $k$-monotone in direction
   $i$ for the same value of $i$.  This makes it easy to eliminate
   crossings by repeatedly swapping segments of the curves and making
   local modifications around the crossings.  Repeating this for every
   crossing pair of edges gives a plane $d_k$ obstacle embedding of $G$.
\end{proof}

\lemref{monotone} allows us to focus our effort on studying the existence
(or not) of plane $d_k$-obstacle embeddings.  This is what we do for
the rest of paper, beginning with plane $d_k$-obstacle representations
of small treewidth graphs.

\subsection{Treewidth}

Some of our results look at the relation between plane $d_k$ obstacle
embeddings and the treewidth of $G$.  A \emph{$k$-tree} is any graph that
can be obtained in the following manner:  We begin with a clique on $k+1$
vertices and then we repeatedly select a subset of the vertices that
form a $k$-clique $K$ and add a new vertex adjacent to every element
in $K$.  The class of $k$-trees is exactly the set of edge-maximal
graphs of treewidth $k$.  We will make use of the following lemma,
due to Dujmovi\'c and Wood \cite[Lemma~1]{dujmovic.wood:graph2007}
in some recursive embeddings.

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{dujwood}
   Every $k$-tree is either a clique on $k+1$ vertices or it contains a non-empty independent set $S$ and a vertex $u\not\in S$, such that:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item $G\setminus S$ is a $k$-tree;
   \item $\deg_{G\setminus S}(u)=k$; and 
   \item every element in $S$ is adjacent to $u$ and $k-1$ elements of
   $N_{G\setminus S}(u)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lem}

A graph $G$ is called a \emph{partial $k$-tree} if it is a subgraph of
some $k$-tree.  The class of partial $k$-trees is exactly the class of
graphs of treewidth at most $k$.  The class of partial 1-trees is the
class of forests.  All partial 2-trees are planar, every outerplanar graph
is a partial 2-tree, and every series-parallel graph is a partial 2-tree.
Not every 3-tree, and hence not every partial 3-trees is planar, since
$K_{3,3}$ is a 3-tree.

\subsection{Grid Obstacle Representations}

In this section we focus on $d_2$-obstacle embeddings.  Recall that these
are equivalent to the non-blocking planar grid obstacle representations
studied by Biedl and Mehrabi \cite{X}.  We begin with a positive result.

\subsubsection{Partial 2-trees have plane $d_2$-obstacle embeddings}

\begin{thm}\thmlabel{2-tree}
  Every partial 2-tree has a plane straight-line $d_2$-obstacle embedding.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  Let $G$ be a partial 2-tree. We can, without loss of generality, assume
  that $G$ is connected.  If $|V(G)|< 4$, then the result is trivial, so
  we can assume $|V(G)|\ge 4$.  We now proceed by induction on $|V(G)|$.

  Let $T=T(G)$ be a 2-tree with vertex set $V(G)$ and that contains $G$.
  Apply \lemref{dujwood} to find the vertex set $S$ and the vertex $u$.
  Let $x$ and $y$ be the neighbours of $u$ in $T\setminus S$. Now apply
  induction to find a straight-line $d_4$ obstacle embedding of the
  graph $G'$ whose vertex set is $V(G')=V(G)\setminus S$ and whose edge
  set is $E(G')=E(G\setminus S)\cup\{ux,uy\}$.

  Now observe that, since $u$ has degree 2 in $G'$ and the edges $ux$
  and $uy$ are in $G'$, this embedding does not contain any monotone path
  of the form $uxw$ or $uyw$ for any $w\in V(G)\setminus\{u,x,y\}$.
  Therefore, if we place the vertices in $S$ sufficiently close to $u$,
  we will not create any monotone path of the form $ayw$ or $axw$ for
  any $a\in S$ and any $w\in V(G)\setminus \{u,x,y\}$.  What remains
  is to show how to place the elements of $S$ in order to avoid unwanted
  monotone paths of the form $uay$, $uax$, or $aub$ for any $a,b\in S$.
  There are three cases to consider (see \figref{2-tree-proof}):

  \caption{The proof of \thmref{2-tree}.}
  \figlabel{2-tree-proof}
  \end{figure}
  
  \begin{enumerate}

  \item  $x\in Q_i(u)$ and $y\in Q_{i+2}(u)$ for some
  $i\in\{0,\ldots,3\}$. Without loss of generality, assume that
  $Q_{i+3}(u)$ does not intersect the segment $xy$. Then we can embed the
  elements of $S$ in $Q_{i+3}$ without creating any new monotone paths.

  \item $x,y\in Q_i(u)$ for some $i\in\{0,\ldots,3\}$. There are two
  subcases:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item At least one of $ux$ or $uy$ is in $E(G)$. Suppose $ux\in E(G)$.
      Then we embed $S_x$ in $Q_i(u)$ and embed $S_y$ in $Q_{i+1}(u)$.
      The only monotone paths this creates are of the form $uax$ with
      $a\in S_x$, which is acceptable since $ux\in E(G)$.
      \item Neither $ux$ nor $uy$ is in $E(G)$. In this case, we embed all
    of $S$ in $Q_{i+2}(u)$.  This does not create any new monotone paths.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item $x\in Q_i(u)$ and $y\in Q_{i+1}(u)$ for some $i\in\{0,\ldots,3\}$.
  We have two subcases to consider:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $|\{ux,uy\}\cap E(G)|=1$.  In this case, assume $ux\in
      E(G)$. Then we embed the vertices of $S_x$ in $Q_i(u)$ and we
      embed the vertices of $S_y$ in $Q_{i+3}(u)$.  The only monotone
      paths this creates are of the form $uax$ with $a\in S_x$, which
      is acceptable since $ux\in E(G)$.
      \item $|\{ux,uy\}\cap E(G)|=2$.  In this case we embed the
      vertices of $S_x$ in $Q_i(u)$ and we embed the vertices of $S_y$
      in $Q_{i+1}(u)$.  The only monotone paths this creates are of the
      form $uax$ with $a\in S_x$ and $uby$ with $b\in S_y$, which is
      acceptable since $ux,uy\in E(G)$.
      \item $|\{ux,uy\}\cap E(G)|=0$.  In this case, we embed all of
      $S$ into $Q_{i+2}\cup Q_{i+3}$.  This does not create any new
      monotone paths.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
This completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{3-Trees do not have plane $d_2$-obstacle embeddings}

Here we establish the bad news: 3-trees do not have plane $d_2$-obstacle
embeddings.  The following lemma is easily established by a short case
analysis:

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{labelling}
  The vertices of any triangle $xyz$ can be labelled so that $y,z\in Q^4_i(x)$ for some $i\in\{0,\ldots,3\}$.
\end{lem}

A (1-level) \emph{subdivision} of a triangle $xyz$ is obtained by adding a
vertex $w$ in the interior of $xyz$ and adding the edges $wx$, $wy$, $wz$.
A $d$-level subdivision of $xyz$ is obtained by repeating this process
recursively to a depth of $d$.

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{level-1}
   Let $G$ be a plane $d_2$-obstacle embedding of some graph, and let $xyz$
   be a three-cycle in $G$ embedded with $x\in Q^4_i(y)$ and $z\in Q^4_i(x)$.
   Then $xyz$ does not contains a 3-level subdivision in its interior.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
   Without loss of generality assume that $i=0$ and $x$ is above the edge
   $yz$ Consider the location of the vertex $w$ that subdivides $xyz$.
   There are three cases to consider:
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item The vertex $w$ is placed in $Q^4_0(x)$.  In this case,
        there will be a 2-monotone path from $z$ to the vertex $w'$ that
        subdivides $xyw$.
      \item The vertex $w$ is placed in $Q^2_0(x)$.  In this case,
        there will be a 2-monotone path from $y$ to the vertex $w'$ that
        subdivides $xwz$.
      \item The vertex $w$ is placed in $Q^4_3(x)$. In this case,
      consider the vertex $w'$ that subdivides $zwy$.  The preceding
      two arguments prevent $w'$ from being placed in $Q^4_0(w)$
      or $Q^4_2(w)$.  However, placing $w'$ in $Q^4_3(w)$ creates a
      monotone path from $x$ to $w'$.
   \end{enumerate} 
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{level-2}
   Let $G$ be a plane $d_2$-obstacle embedding of some graph, and let
   $xyz$ be a three-cycle in $G$ with $yz\in Q_i(x)$ for some $i$.
   Then $xyz$ does not contains a 4-level subdivision in its interior.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
   If $xyz$ does not already meet the criteria for \lemref{level-1}, then
   any choice of location for the first-level subdivision vertex will create
   at least one triangle that does meet the criteria for \lemref{level-1}.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}\thmlabel{stellated}
   The graph $G$ that is a 5-level subdivision of a triangle does not
   have a non-blocking grid obstacle representation.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
   In any embedding of $G$, there is a triangle $xyz$ with a 4-level
   subdivision in its interior.  The theorem then follows since, by
   \lemref{labelling}, we can apply \lemref{level-1} to $xyz$.
\end{proof}

We note that the graph in \thmref{stellated} is a planar 3 tree.
Thefore, Theorems~\ref{thm:2-tree} and \ref{thm:stellated} tell us that
all planar graph of treewidth at most 2 have plane $d_2$-obstacle embeddings,
but not all planar graph of treewidth 3 do.

   \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/triangular-grid}
   \end{center}
   \caption{A $d_2$-obstacle embedding of the hexagonal grid.}
\end{figure}


Although some planar graphs of treewidth 3 do not have $d_2$-obstacle
embeddings, the infinite hexagonal grid (and hence every induced subgraph
of this grid) has a plane $d_2$-obstacle embedding.  This embedding
is shown in \figref{hexagonal}.  This means that there are $n$-vertex
planar graphs of treewidth $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ that have $d_2$-obstacle
embeddings, so perhaps treewidth is not the most important parameter.

\subsection{4-Connected triangulations do not have plane $d_2$-obstacle embeddings}

Talk about skinny triangles and why 4-connected might work instead.


One as aspect of 3-trees that stands out is that 3-trees tend to incluce, and that is used in the proof that they do not have 

\subsection{Hexagon Grid Obstacle Representations}
 
Next, we study plane $d_3$-obstacle embeddings.

\begin{thm}
  Every planar graph of treewidth at most 3 has a plane $d_3$-obstacle embedding.   
\end{thm}

\subsection{Planar graphs have plane $d_{X}$ obstacle embeddings}

\section{Graph Metrics}

For a graph $H$, let $d_H$ denote the graph distance and let $C_H$ denote the set of curves that define paths in $H$.

Let $Q_n$ denote the $n$ dimensional hypercube.

\begin{thm}
  Every $n$ vertex graph has a $(\{0,1\}^n,d_{Q_n},C_{Q_n})$ obstacle
  representation.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  Easy.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
  Let $D=c\log n$.
  Every $n$ vertex graph has a $(\{0,1\}^D,d_{Q_D},C_{Q_D})$ obstacle
  representation.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
   Assign everyone random identifiers. 

   For any vertex pair $u\neq w$, $\Pr\{|d(u,w)-D/2| > \eps(D/2)\}
   \le n^{\Omega(c)}$

   For each pair $u$ and $w$, take the greedy monotone path from $u$ to $w$.

   Let $uw_i$ denote the $i$th vertex on the path from $u$ to $w$.  Then,
   for distinct $u,w,x,y$, $\Pr\{d(uw_1,xy_j)\le 1\} \le (D+1)/2^{D}$. 
   Now use the union bound of $\binom{n}{2}D$ things.

   If any geodesic from $u$ to $w$ comes within distance $r$ of $x$, then
   either $d(u,w)> (1+\eps)D/2$ or $d(u,x) < (1+\eps)D/4-r$ or $d(w,x) <
   (1+\eps)D/4-r$. So this doesn't happen for $r<(1-\eps)D/(4(1+\epsilon))$

   Finally, the probability that the embeddings of $xu$ and $xw$ stay within distance 1 of each other for more than $r$ steps is at most the probability that a binomial(r,1/2) random variable is less than $2$, which is at most $r+1/2^r$, so this doesn't happen for $r>(1+\eps)\log n$.

   So the embedding is such that no two edges have adjacent vertices
   except for a radius $r$ neighbourhood around their common endpoint. 
   On the other hand, no geodesic from $u$ to $w$ comes within distance $r$ of $x$, so there are no transitive paths. 
\end{proof}
